\textit{Brun et al.}\cite{SAS02} applies the definition of orthogonality in self-adaptive systems to represent independent dimensions where any modification in one of them do not cause impact on the others. They are completely independent and can be adjusted according to the requirements. In our proposed model, the two dimensions presented, as a DSPL set and a C2 Approach, are \textit{quasi-orthogonal}. In this work, we are using this term to express a partial dependence among these two dimensions. It means that changes in any of them may cause reactions in the other, but this effect is not mandatory.
